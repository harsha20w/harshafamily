We got married in <span class="highlight">2000 February 11</span>. We are blessed with two children, one is <span class="highlight">Yeswanth in 2001 April 13</span> and another one is <span class="highlight">Harshavardhan in 2003 June 14</span>. I'm the one who carries my family responsibilities from a young age. At 14 I stopped my studies because of financial problems. At that time we had public exams for both 7th and 10th class and I topped in the 7th class public exams. After that I stopped my studies and started working to support my family. My mother sold vegetables, my father had passed away, and my brother was not ready to take responsibility. I did labour work in the centering field, and after some years, I learned.</p>

We have two children — my elder son Yeswanth was born on April 11, 2001, and my younger son Harshavardhan on June 4, 2003. My elder son passed away in a bike accident on November 4, 2021. From that day, my family has been heartbroken. He was the most beloved child in our entire family. Even during his death ceremony, thousands of people gathered — a sign of how special he was. My younger son has recently graduated in Electrical Engineering and is now learning a course to get into the IT field.</p>
